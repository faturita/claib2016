\subsection{BCI Model}
----------------------------

BCIs can be modeled as 

$$
y(n) = \mathcal{T} (X(n)) \eqno{(1)}
$$

where $ X(n) $ is the input signal (from the data acquisition hardware), $ \mathcal{T} $ is a transformation and finally $ y(n) $ is the actual control signal.  In its simplest scheme, some known cognitive pattern, produce a set of signals $ X(n) $ and the purpose of the BCI is to calculate some nonlinear transformation producing at least a 1-bit long  $ y(n) $ for us to determine the desired or induced cognitive situation.  This non-linear transformation can be further divided into well known functions like Signal Acquisition, Feature Extraction and Feature Translation/Classification.
